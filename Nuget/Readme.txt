# WebView2 DevTools DOM

WebView2 DevTools Dom is a port of [puppeteer-sharp by Dar√≠o Kondratiuk](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) that has been adapted specifically for use with WebView2.
- Direct communication with the CoreWebView2 via the DevTools protocol (no need to open a Remote Debugging Port).
- 1:1 mapping of WebView2DevToolsContext and CoreWebView2 (create a single WebView2DevToolsContext per CoreWebView2 instance)
- The primary focus of this project is DOM access/manipulation and Javascript execution/evaluation.
- Only a **subset** of the Puppeteer Sharp features were ported (It maybe possible to port additional features if sufficent user demand).
